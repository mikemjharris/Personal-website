## My Website

This is my static website. It started life back in 2011 and has evolved and grown over time.  From a bunch of flies ftpd up to a server it now exists in source control with webhooks and automatic deplyment.  The core of it is just a static site so nothing too fancy but it does link into various subapps - most of the code for those can be found on github too.

#### Running the project

This site is up and running at [mikemjharris.com](http://mikemjharris.com). If for some reason you want to host my website it is just a static website.  Pull everything down and just use your favorite piece of kit to server the files. 

#### Playing around

Feel free to look/borrow/reuse any of the code.  Be aware that it is a diary of of webdevelopment since 2011 and the solidity of the code varies widely! If you do decided to borrow anything a citation or referrence would be much appreciated.
