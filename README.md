## My Website

This is my static website. It started life back in 2011 and has evolved and grown over time.  Generally I have just uploaded files to my server when I create a new project.  It's 2015 now and I'm changing how my site is hosted and deployed. I have also decided to do a spring clean and start using version control.  There is lots of cleaning to do!

#### Running the project

This site is up and running at [mikemjharris.com](http://mikemjharris.com). If for some reason you want to host my website it is just a static website.  Pull everything down and just use your favorite piece of kit to server the files.  

#### Playing around

Feel free to look/borrow/reuse any of the code.  Be aware that it is a diary of four years of webdevelopment and the solidity of the code varies widely! If you do decided to borrow anything a citation or referrrence would be much appreciated.
