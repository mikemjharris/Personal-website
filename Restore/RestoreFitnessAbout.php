		<h2>About RESTORE FITNESS</h2>
<p>Restore Fitness is a service which caters to all those who wish to get back 
into fitness and health but have experienced a set-back due to injury, 
pregnancy, stress or simply a busy life preventing you putting your health 
first. Life places your body under an inordinate amount of physical and mental 
stress and sometimes a coach and fitness mentor is all you need to see you 
on the road to optimum health. Every body and mind is different and Restore 
Fitness sees the value in tailoring your support whether it be massage or 
personal training to get the results that are right for you. 

<h2>About Eleanor Haywood</h2>

<p>Personal trainer and sports massage therapist I believe in a functional fitness, a fitness capable of meeting everyday 
demands, a fitness that can withstand injury, and a fitness that permeates through all aspects of life. My approach is to make fitness sustained and 
sustaining, not just a quick fix or temporary high. I have a military background and so my passion is for the outdoors, whatever 
the weather! However we can also train from your home or from a studio in Battersea.</p>
<br>
<p>I am fully REPs qualified and insured. I am also pre and post natal trained and can conduct postural assessments and a full biomechanics analysis prior to 
any fitness commencing.</p>
