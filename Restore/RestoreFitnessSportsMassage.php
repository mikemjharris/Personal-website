		<h2>RESTORE FORM with sports massage therapy</h2>

<p>Sports massage is proven to:</p>
<ul>
	<li>aid muscle recovery 3-5 times faster than rest</li>
	<li>ease tension from stiff and sore muscles</li>
	<li>reduce risk of future injury and boost muscle function
	<li>assist health, healing and repair</li>
	<li>improve biomechanical efficiency through restoring ranges of movement</li>
</ul>
<p> If you wish to recover strength, reduce tension or restore physical form, 
professional sports massage is for you. Treatment starts with assessing the 
specific cause of your muscle tension. We will then create a plan to address
symptoms and underlying causes, in line with your training needs. Sports 
massage treatment incorporates trigger point therapy and muscle energy 
techniques as appropriate.</p>
<br>
<p>Conditioning massages are available for those in training and recovery.</p>
<br>
<p>Discount packages are available for block bookings.</p>
