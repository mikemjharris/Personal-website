		<h2>RESTORE ENERGY with postnatal fitness</h2>
<p>Restore Energy is an outdoor exercise class for hard-working mums who 
crave fresh air, light fitness and an enjoyable way to de-stress. It includes a 
recommended free consultation (exercise induction). Home visits available.</p>
<br>
<p>This will be 60 minutes of 'you time' with buggies and babies by your side. 
Taking place in Battersea Park and Hampstead Heath, these sessions wake 
up muscles and get hearts, lungs and energy systems fully switched on. Your 
fitness instructor, Eleanor Haywood, is qualified in safe, effective exercise and 
tailors sessions to get energy restored to your day and back in tune with a 
mother's changing body.</p>
<br>
<p>Classes are for all fitness levels and for all stages of natal recovery, after your 
doctor declares you ready for exercise.</p>
<br>	
<p><i>New concept class in Jan 2014: CarryFit - this workout includes use of a 
sports-designed baby harness to add a fun resistance aspect to classes whilst 
keeping your baby safe and close. Class sizes limited to 6; fathers welcome; 
approved baby harnesses provided.</i></p>
