            WDI is a twelve week immersive course run by General Assembly. During the course students cover a wide range of languages and technologies allowing them to build and deploy their own project.  
            <br /><br />
            As part of the course each student does two individual projects as well as a group project.  In addition many mini projects are completed as homework. 
            <br /><br />

            <h3>Mike Harris</h3>
            <div>Mike loves the way that programming and design makes his brain work. The delight he gets from solving problems in order to create interesting projects brought him to study at General Assembly. He has really enjoyed learning how to think as a programmer. To take his learning further, he built his final project using tools that weren't covered in the course (Node, MongoDB, Angular). He found it extemely rewarding translating concepts from the course into these new areas.
            <br /><br />
            Mike has worked in a variety of different roles in Finance both in London and New York and has a degree in Maths.
            <br /><br /> 
            As for the next stage, Mike is looking to be stretched, to learn from those around him and to feel that his contribution is making a difference. Hopefully he won't have to speak in the third person in the future.

          <h3>WDI Class March 2014</h3>

          <div>
            WDI is a twelve week immersive course run by General Assembly. During the course students cover a wide range of languages and technologies allowing them to build and deploy their own project.  
            <br /><br />
            As part of the course each student does two individual projects as well as a group project.  In addition many mini projects are completed as homework. 
            <br /><br />
            Select a student to see their bio and a sample of the work they have accomplished over the length of the course.
